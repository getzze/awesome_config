  * widget library and themes
* [vicious](https://github.com/Mic92/vicious)

  * other (!) widget library

I also use a modified version of [APW](https://github.com/mokasin/apw).
My theme is a modified version of japanese2 from [blingbling](https://github.com/cedlemo/blingbling).
Some of the icons come from the libre icon set [iconic](https://github.com/iconic/open-iconic).

The libraries come from various sources, including:
* keydoc.lua from [https://github.com/vincentbernat/awesome-configuration].
* inspect.lua from [https://github.com/kikito/inspect.lua]
* xrandr.lua from awesome wiki [http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Using_Multiple_Screens]
